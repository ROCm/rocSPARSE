# Change Log for rocSPARSE

Full documentation for rocSPARSE is available at [rocsparse.readthedocs.io](https://rocsparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## rocSPARSE 2.1.0 for ROCm 5.1.0
### Added
- gtsv_interleaved_batch
- gpsv_interleaved_batch
- SpGEMM_reuse
- Allow copying of mat info struct
### Improved
- Optimization for SDDMM
- Allow unsorted matrices in csrgemm multipass algorithm
### Known Issues
- none

## rocSPARSE 2.0.0 for ROCm 5.0.0
### Added
- csrmv, coomv, ellmv, hybmv for (conjugate) transposed matrices
- csrmv for symmetric matrices
### Changed
- spmm\_ex is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release
### Improved
- Optimization for gtsv

## rocSPARSE 1.22.2 for ROCm 4.5.0
### Added
- Triangular solve for multiple right-hand sides using BSR format
- SpMV for BSRX format
- SpMM in CSR format enhanced to work with transposed A
- Matrix coloring for CSR matrices
- Added batched tridiagonal solve (gtsv\_strided\_batch)
- SpMM for BLOCKED ELL format
- Generic routines for SpSV and SpSM
- Enabling beta support for Windows 10
- Additional atomic based algorithms for SpMM in COO format
- Extended version of SpMM
- Additional algorithm for SpMM in CSR format
- Added (conjugate) transpose support for csrmv and SpMV (CSR) routines
### Changed
- Packaging split into a runtime package called rocsparse and a development package called rocsparse-devel. The development package depends on runtime. The runtime package suggests the development package for all supported OSes except CentOS 7 to aid in the transition. The suggests feature in packaging is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future rocm release.
