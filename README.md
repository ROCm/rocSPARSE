# rocSPARSE
rocSPARSE exposes a common interface that provides Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for sparse computation implemented on top of AMD's Radeon Open Compute [ROCm][] runtime and toolchains. rocSPARSE is created using the [HIP][] programming language and optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs.

## Documentation
The latest rocSPARSE documentation and API description can be found [here][].

## Requirements
* Git
* CMake (3.5 or later)
* AMD [ROCm] 2.5 platform or later

Optional:
* [GTest][]
  * Required for tests.
  * Use GTEST_ROOT to specify GTest location.
  * If [GTest][] is not found, it will be downloaded and built automatically.
* [Boost][]
  * Required for benchmarks.

## Quickstart rocSPARSE build and install

#### Install script
You can build rocSPARSE using the *install.sh* script
```
# Clone rocSPARSE using git
git clone https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocSPARSE.git

# Go to rocSPARSE directory
cd rocSPARSE

# Run install.sh script
# Command line options:
#   -h|--help         - prints help message
#   -i|--install      - install after build
#   -d|--dependencies - install build dependencies
#   -c|--clients      - build library clients too (combines with -i & -d)
#   -g|--debug        - build with debug flag
#   --hip-clang       - build library for amdgpu backend using hip-clang
./install.sh -dci
```

#### CMake
All compiler specifications are determined automatically. The compilation process can be performed by
```
# Clone rocSPARSE using git
git clone https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocSPARSE.git

# Go to rocSPARSE directory, create and go to the build directory
cd rocSPARSE; mkdir -p build/release; cd build/release

# Configure rocSPARSE
# Build options:
#   BUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS      - build tests (OFF)
#   BUILD_CLIENTS_BENCHMARKS - build benchmarks (OFF)
#   BUILD_CLIENTS_SAMPLES    - build examples (ON)
#   BUILD_VERBOSE            - verbose output (OFF)
#   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS        - build rocSPARSE as a shared library (ON)
CXX=/opt/rocm/bin/hcc cmake -DBUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS=ON ../..

# Build
make

# Install
[sudo] make install
```

## Unit tests
To run unit tests, rocSPARSE has to be built with option -DBUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS=ON.
```
# Go to rocSPARSE build directory
cd rocSPARSE; cd build/release

# Run all tests
./clients/staging/rocsparse-test
```

## Benchmarks
To run benchmarks, rocSPARSE has to be built with option -DBUILD_CLIENTS_BENCHMARKS=ON.
```
# Go to rocSPARSE build directory
cd rocSPARSE/build/release

# Run benchmark, e.g.
./clients/staging/rocsparse-bench -f hybmv --laplacian-dim 2000 -i 200
```
