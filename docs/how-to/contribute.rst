Acceptance Criteria
===================

rocSPARSE is a library that contains basic linear algebra subroutines for sparse matrices and vectors written in HIP for GPU devices.
It is designed to be used from C and C++ code. The functionality of rocSPARSE is organized in the following categories:

* Sparse Auxiliary Functions: helper functions that are required for subsequent library calls.
* Sparse Level 1 Functions: operations between a vector in sparse format and a vector in dense format.
* Sparse Level 2 Functions: operations between a matrix in sparse format and a vector in dense format.
* Sparse Level 3 Functions: operations between a matrix in sparse format and multiple vectors in dense format.
* Sparse Extra Functions: operations that manipulate sparse matrices.
* Preconditioner Functions: manipulations on a matrix in sparse format to obtain a preconditioner.
* Sparse Conversion Functions: operations on a matrix in sparse format to obtain a different matrix in sparse format.
* Reordering Functions: operations on a matrix in sparse format to obtain a reordering.
* Utility Functions: routines useful for checking sparse matrices for valid data

In rocSPARSE we are interested in contributions that:
* Fix bugs, improve documentation, enhance testing, reduce complexity.
* Improve the performance of existing routines.
* Add missing functionality found in one of the categories above.
* Add additional sparse matrix formats or allow an existing format to be used with an existing routine.

Some of the routines in rocSPARSE allow users to choose between multiple different algorithms. This is useful for obtaining the most performance for different use cases (as some algorithms may perform better than others depending on the sparse matrix) or for satisfying important user requirements (such as run-to-run reproducibility). The following is a non-exhaustive list of reasons for including alternate algorithms:

* Some algorithms may perform better when a sparse matrix has roughly the same number of non-zeros per row.
* Some algorithms may perform better when a sparse matrix has a large variation in the number of non-zeros per row.
* Some algorithms may perform better if they are allowed to use a large amount of device memory.
* Some algorithms may perform better or worse depending on whether a user intends to perform the computation only once or many times.
* Some algorithms may exist to allow for reproducibility between runs, for example by not using atomic operations.
* Some algorithms may exist because they do not require any additional memory allocation or analysis phase.
* Some algorithms may handle different ranges in sparse matrix size, i.e number of rows or number of non-zeros.

An opportunity exists here for contributors to add different algorithms that optimize for important user requirements and performance considerations. We encourage contributors to leverage the GitHub "Issues" tab to discuss possible additions they would like to add.

Exceptions
----------

rocSPARSE places a heavy emphasis on being high performance. Because of this, contributions that add new routines (or that modify existing routines) must do so from the perspective that they offer high performance in relation to the hardware they are run on. Typically in rocSPARSE this evaluation is done using approximations of GFLOPS/s or GB/s and comparing this to what the device is estimated to achieve. Comparison to other sparse math libraries is also useful.

Additionally, when adding new routines, these routines must offer enough value to enough users to be deemed worth including. Because compile times, binary sizes, and general library complexity are important considerations, we reserve the right to make decisions on whether a proposed routine is too niche or specialized to be worth including.

Code Structure
==============

The following is the structure of the rocSPARSE library in the GitHub repository. A more detailed description of the directory structure can be found in the `rocSPARSE documentation <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSPARSE/en/latest/design.html>`_.

The ``library/include/`` directory contains the rocsparse.h header (which itself includes headers defining the public API of rocSPARSE). The ``library/include/`` directory also contains the headers for all the rocSPARSE public types.

The ``library/src/`` directory contains the implementations of all the rocSPARSE routines. These implementations are broken up into directories describing the category the routine belongs too, i.e. level1, level2, level3, etc. These directories contain both the C++ and HIP kernel code.

The ``clients/`` directory contains the testing and benchmarking code as well as all the samples demonstrating rocSPARSE usage.

The ``docs/`` directory contains all of the documentation files.

The ``scripts/`` directory contains potentially useful python and shell scripts for downloading test matrices (see ``scripts/performance/matrices/``) as well as plotting tools. See `rocSPARSE documentation <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocSPARSE/en/latest/design.html>`_ for more details.

Coding Style
============

In general, follow the style of the surrounding code. C and C++ code is formatted using ``clang-format``. Use the clang-format version installed with ROCm (found in the ``/opt/rocm/llvm/bin`` directory). Please do not use your system's built-in ``clang-format``, as this is a different version that may result in incorrect results.

To format a file, use:

```
/opt/rocm/hcc/bin/clang-format -style=file -i <path-to-source-file>
```

To format all files, run the following script in rocSPARSE directory:

```
#!/bin/bash
git ls-files -z *.cc *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.cl *.h.in *.hpp.in *.cpp.in | xargs -0 /opt/rocm/hcc/bin/clang-format  -style=file -i
```

Also, githooks can be installed to format the code per-commit:

```
./.githooks/install
```

Pull Request Guidelines
=======================

When you create a pull request, you should target the default branch. Our current default branch is the **develop** branch, which serves as our integration branch.

Deliverables
------------

When raising a PR in rocSPARSE here are some important things to include:

1. For each new file in the repository, Please include the licensing header

.. code-block:: cpp
    :caption: rocsparse_file_header

and adjust the date to the current year. When simply modifying a file, the date should automatically be updated when using the pre-commit script.

2. When adding a new routine, please make sure you are also adding appropriate testing code. These new unit tests should integrate within the existing `googletest framework <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md>`_. This typically involves adding the following files:

* testing_<routine_name>.cpp file in the directory ``clients/testing/``
* test_<routine_name>.cpp file in directory ``clients/tests/``
* test_<routine_name>.yaml file in directory ``clients/tests/``

See existing tests for guidance when adding your own.

3. When modifiying an existing routine, add appropriate testing to test_<routine_name>.yaml file in directory ``clients/tests/``.

4. Tests must have good code coverage.

5. At a minimum, rocSPARSE supports the following data/compute formats:

* ``float``
* ``double``
* ``rocsparse_float_complex``
* ``rocsparse_double_complex``

So when adding a new routine that uses data/compute values please support at least these four types.

6. Ensure code builds successfully. This includes making sure that the code can compile, that the code is properly formatted, and that all tests pass.

7. Do not break existing test cases

Process
-------

When a PR is raised targetting the develop branch in rocSPARSE, CI will be automatically triggered. This will:

* Test that the PR passes static analysis (i.e ensure clang formatting rules have been followed).
* Test that the documentation can be properly built
* Ensure that the PR compiles on different OS and GPU device architecture combinations
* Ensure that all tests pass on different OS and GPU device architecture combinations

Feel free to ask questions on your PR regarding any CI failures you encounter.

* Reviewers are listed in the CODEOWNERS file
