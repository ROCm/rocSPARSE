/*! \ingroup generic_module
*  \brief Check matrix to see if it is valid.
*
*  \details
*  \p rocsparse_check_spmat checks if the input matrix is valid.
*
*  \note
*  This function writes the required allocation size (in bytes) to \p buffer_size and
*  returns without performing the checking operation, when stage is equal to
*  \ref rocsparse_check_spmat_stage_buffer_size.
*
*  \note
*  The sparse matrix formats currently supported are: rocsparse_format_coo, rocsparse_format_csr,
*  rocsparse_format_csc and rocsparse_format_ell.
*
*  \note check_spmat requires two stages to complete. The first stage
*  \ref rocsparse_check_spmat_stage_buffer_size will return the size of the temporary storage buffer
*  that is required for subsequent calls to \ref rocsparse_check_spmat.
*  In the final stage \ref rocsparse_check_spmat_stage_compute, the actual computation is performed.
*
*  \note
*  This routine does not support execution in a hipGraph context.
*
*  @param[in]
*  handle      handle to the rocsparse library context queue.
*  @param[in]
*  mat         matrix descriptor.
*  @param[out]
*  data_status modified to indicate the status of the data
*  @param[in]
*  stage       check_matrix stage for the matrix computation.
*  @param[out]
*  buffer_size number of bytes of the temporary storage buffer. buffer_size is set when
*              \p temp_buffer is nullptr.
*  @param[in]
*  temp_buffer temporary storage buffer allocated by the user. When a nullptr is passed,
*              the required allocation size (in bytes) is written to \p buffer_size and
*              function returns without performing the checking operation.
*
*  \retval     rocsparse_status_success the operation completed successfully.
*  \retval     rocsparse_status_invalid_handle the library context was not initialized.
*  \retval     rocsparse_status_invalid_pointer \p mat, \p buffer_size, \p temp_buffer or \p data_status pointer
*              is invalid.
*  \retval     rocsparse_status_invalid_value the value of stage is incorrect.
